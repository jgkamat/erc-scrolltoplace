An erc module to try to emulate 'scrolltobottom' while keep-place is activated.

* Overview

The ~keep-place~ erc module is very nice, because it let's you find where you
were when you last saw an erc buffer! It does this by moving point up one line
if point is in the input bar.

However, after turning on ~keep-place~ it's common to see something like the
following:

Scrolltoplace tries to change this so you will /always/ see the following:

Even as new messages come in, you'll be able to see them, and point will stay
were it is.

This module does not touch point at all, so once your screen fills with
messages, you won't see new ones, since doing so would require moving
point.

If this annoys you, you could add a function hook to move point to point-max
whenever switching away from an erc buffer.
